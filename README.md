TODOS:
- automated GRUB installation (still needed to select a device to install GRUB to)
- add nuke password
- create proper user and hash the passwords
- hash the disk encryption password
- rename files for easier boot-parameter modification
- crate a minimal installation preseed file (only minimal packages installed). this should be used for testing purposes, when you want to minimize installation duration
-- this one should not eject boot media (e.g. iso file) after install
